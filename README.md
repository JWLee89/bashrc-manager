# Bashrc-manager

A simple rust project to manage the .bashrc file. I created this project to learn rust and to manage my .bashrc file.

## Features (WIP)

The project is still in development, but the following features are planned: 

- Backup: Backup the current .bashrc file inside of a database
- Import / export: Import and export the .bashrc file via a database or JSON files.
- Edit: Edit the .bashrc file via the command line
- Point to a different bashrc file other than the default location
- Load bashrc settings from a online repository (e.g. github)
